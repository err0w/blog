**An Investment thesis for India based Venture Capital Funds**

Author - Saurabh Meena

The basics -

My comfort zone lies in breaking traditional systems, breaking traditional notions & being contrarian. My decisions are based on the fact that:

1. **_Contrarian Ideas are highest value generating ideas_** - Highest value generating moves are contrarian moves with majority consensus being on the failure side. The way I think & back ideas is like this: _“if all experts agree that it is a good idea; it’s definitely a bad idea. If all experts agree that it is a bad idea, it is probably a bad idea but if there’s a strong debate among experts on the idea being good or bad; it is definitely a good idea”_

2. **_Outcome = Decision Quality + Randomness/Luck_** - Luck is a pretty old concept but I see luck as randomness due to infinite variables that exist in the real world. Decision quality is the only factor that a VC and a founding team can control. World class teams are the teams which can make quality decisions even after facing multiple setbacks and do not suffer from hindsight bias.

3. **_Execution trumps everything -_** A team that can make good decisions all the time might be just helping their competitors. A good team has to have capabilities to execute the decisions that they make. Good executors are ground to earth, ready to get their hands dirty and do not talk in jargons.

Where do opportunities exist in Indian Startups -

1. Vertically integrated companies serving India

2. Companies producing world class innovative products at a cheaper price points

3. Companies that can get to IPO at $200m - $500m valuations with strong profitability
