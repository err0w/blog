# Suffering is Important

Fear & Greed are building blocks of all other human emotions and may be the ultimate truth we seek. We have economic terms for both, fear is associated with risk and greed with returns. Both are intertwined at the very fundamental level as shown by economics.

The society forces most of us to give up certain things that *we truly care about* but giving up anything for the society is not good for society and neither it is good for us. 

In reality, most of our choices are ours only. However, every choice comes with certain consequence. Humans are risk averse 

## But why we do it?
We suffer for the ourselves, for we want the society to maintain its status quo. We do it for family, friends, siblings, collegues, causes etc.
