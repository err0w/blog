# Can We Truly Know Someone?

Consider the following hypothetical scenarios:

1. As a huge fan of Jitendra Kumar (known for his roles in Panchayat & TVF), I have acquired extensive knowledge about him - his birthdate, favorite color, and famous movie quotes. One day, I saw him walking down the street, and I was taken aback. Uncertain of what to do, I recalled the impersonal knowledge I had about him. So I gathered the courage and shouted, "Hey Jeetu Bhaiya, I know you were born on August 11th, and your favorite color is blue!" He smiled politely and continued walking.

2. While conversing with a potential arranged marriage prospect named Karishma (a fictional character ðŸ˜›), I learned many things about her - her interests, hobbies, political views, goals, and personal history. One day, a mutual friend mentioned something about her that seemed incorrect, and I immediately responded, "You are wrong!"

Now, let's explore a few questions related to knowing someone:

1. Do I truly know Jeetu or Karishma? Which one do I know better?
2. Are Jeetu, Karishma, and, by extension, all of us merely collections of impersonal facts and figures? Does having this knowledge mean that we genuinely know a person?
3. What does it truly mean to know someone? Is it even possible, or are we all enigmas waiting to be unraveled?
4. What do we mean when we say, "I know person X"?

These questions aren't merely intellectual exercises; they have significant implications for personal and professional relationships. We often find ourselves making decisions on behalf of our family, friends, stakeholders, and users. How can we be certain that we are acting in their best interest if we aren't sure whether we truly know them or not?

## Is It Possible to Know Someone?

Based on empirical evidence, we can confirm that knowing a person is indeed possible. For example, "I know myself, and I am a person." Furthermore, knowing someone exists on a spectrum, ranging from being a fan or stalker to self-knowledge. The scale can be represented as follows:

Broadly speaking, knowing a person can be divided into three areas:

1. **Knowing by Observing**: Imagine a hypothetical scenario where an individual has been observing you since the day you were born. This observer possesses an infallible memory and an unwavering attention to detail. They can track your every movement and reveal that they know you better than you know yourself when a critical decision is at hand. This raises the fundamental question: Can someone who has been monitoring your every move truly claim to know you? While there is a degree of knowledge obtained from observing someone from afar, it remains minimal.

2. **Knowing by Interaction**: Interaction occurs when two individuals engage in an exchange, involving actions, addresses, and responses. Every action we take that affects another person constitutes an interaction. Interactions form the basis of how we come to know our friends, family, colleagues, and others. These interactions can take various forms, such as phone calls, messaging, shared activities, and more.

3. **Knowing by Experiencing or Knowing Self**: Knowledge about oneself is distinct and unique, unlike any other form of knowledge. While our knowledge about others stems from third-person references, our knowledge about ourselves is first-personal. **I know myself through being, acting, and experiencing**. Understanding oneself as "I" provides a special perspective that cannot be reduced to internalized third-personal knowledge.

Now that we have established the scale, the question arises: "How do we progress from being a stalker to truly knowing someone as well as we know ourselves?" The answer lies in the nature of interactions. However, it is crucial to determine what kind of interactions ensure that we know someone as intimately as we know ourselves.

To answer that, we need to address another question: **"What defines a person?"**

Rather than delving into an existential crisis by attempting to answer this question (something I've experienced ðŸ˜›), let's start with a widely accepted definition agreed upon by philosophers:

A person, or someone possessing personhood, is an agent that fulfills the following criteria:

1. **Rationality or being a rational agent**: This means the person is capable of making the best possible decisions based on the given situation. However, what constitutes the "best possible action" is subjective and depends on the person's goals, ethics, aspirations, and more.

2. **Conscious mental state and intentionality**: A person has the ability to reflect, plan, and represent things, properties, or states of affairs. They possess a conscious mind.

3. **Subject of special regard by other persons**: A person is regarded with a special stance or regard by others. How others perceive and regard the person contributes to their identity.

4. **Ability to give regard to other persons**: A person not only receives regard from others but is also capable of giving regard to others. They have their own opinions and thoughts about others.

5. **Self-consciousness**: This aspect involves a person's self-awareness and self-perception. It delves into the complexity of one's self-identity and understanding.

While this definition represents a person in a single moment or present moment, it is essential to consider the time-series continuity of a person. People change, and personal continuity can be understood in different ways:

1. **Psychological Continuity or Connectedness**: This refers to the psychological relations between different mental states and events, such as memory, persistence of intentions, desires, and other psychological features.

2. **Biological Continuity**: This focuses on the biological relations between different biological states or events at different points in time. It encompasses changes in physical aspects, health conditions, dietary preferences, and more.

3. **Narratives**: People construct narratives or stories about themselves that shape their self-perception and understanding. These narratives provide insights into their personal journey, experiences, and self-identity.

To truly know someone on an absolute scale, we need to consider the following:

1. **Understanding the person's perspective**: To what extent can we answer the question, "What would be the best possible action for this person in a particular situation, from their perspective?" This requires empathy and an understanding of their values, goals, and circumstances.

2. **Recognizing their representations and opinions**: What does this person represent or stand for, according to their own beliefs and how others perceive them? Understanding their perspectives and opinions on events, objects, and ideas is crucial to knowing them.

3. **Considering the perception of others**: What do others think about this person? How do their relationships and interactions with others shape their identity and reputation?

4. **Understanding their thoughts about others**: What does this person think about others? How do they perceive and regard other individuals in their lives?

5. **Tracking psychological changes over time**: How have this person's intentions, desires, and other psychological features evolved and transformed over time? Understanding their personal growth and changes contributes to knowing them more deeply.

6. **Observing biological aspects**: How have the person's biological aspects changed over time? This goes beyond physical appearance and includes factors such as health conditions, dietary preferences, and overall well-being.

7. **Exploring their narratives**: What are the stories and narratives this person tells themselves about themselves? These narratives shape their self-perception, identity, and understanding of their own journey.

At the end of the day, it's important to acknowledge that it might not be possible to truly know someone completely, as people change. Just think about the introductions you've had over the last few years or the introductions you've made in different contexts. However, when it comes to knowing someone, interactions are our only way forward.
