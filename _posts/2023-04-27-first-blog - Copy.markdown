Consider following hypothetical scenarios:
1. _As a huge Jitendra Kumar (the Panchayat & TVF fame) fan, I know everything about him - his birthdate, his favorite color, and his most famous movie quotes. But one day, I saw him walking down the street and I froze. I didn't know what to do, but then I remembered all the impersonal knowledge I had about him. So I shouted out - "Hey Jeetu Bhaiya, I know you were born on August 11th and that your favorite color is blue! He smiled politely and kept walking‚Äù_
2. _"Talking to an arranged marriage prospect named Karishma (fictional character üòõ), I got to know many things about her - interests, hobbies, political views, goals, history etc. One day, a common friend mentioned somethings about her which seemed wrong to me and I said 'You are wrong!"_

Now consider about following questions:
1. Do I know really Jeetu or Karishma? Which one do I know better?
2. Are Jeetu & Karishma (and by extension, we all) just a collection of impersonal facts & figures? And does knowing all these facts & figures mean that we know the person?
3. What does it mean to know someone ? Is it even possible or are we just a mystery waiting to be explored ?
4. What do we mean when we say "I know person X"? 

These questions aren't just intellectual excercise but have important implications for personal & professional relationships as we have to take decisions on behalf of our family & friends, stakeholders & users and how can we be sure whether we are doing right thing for them if we cannot be sure on whether we know them or not. 

## Is it possible to know someone?
By empirical evidences, we know that knowing a person is possible as "I know myself and I am **person**" and also that knowing someone has to be a scale - From being a fan/stalker to knowing myself. The scale should look as follows:
![knowing_scale](knowing_scale.png "Knowing A person Scale") 


Broadly the scale of knowing a person can be divided into three areas:
1. Knowing by afar or knowing by observation
2. Knowing by interaction
3. Knowing by experiencing / knowing self

### Knowing by afar or knowing by observation
Imagine a hypothetical scenario where there is an individual who has been keeping a watchful eye on you since the day you were born. This observer has an infallible memory and nothing escapes his attention, no matter how insignificant. He can track your movements across the world and nothing can ever escape his sight. One day, you find yourself on the brink of making a major decision, such as relocating to a different part of the world or marrying someone, and this mysterious observer reveals himself, warning you that it would be a mistake as he knows you better than you know yourself. This raises the fundamental question: can someone who has been monitoring your every move truly claim to know you?

There is certain degree of knowledge about a person when observing that person from afar. We, all have such person in our lives whom we see/observe daily during commute, in office, on social media, tv etc. We feel a certain degree of comfort with such people and I would classify this as minima of knowing someone

### Knowing by interaction
Interaction is an encounter between two agents consisting of a form of address/action and response within overarching unity of a single act. Everything we do that affects someone else is essentially an interaction. Interactions is how we know our friends, family, collegues etc.

The interactions are of different types, for eg - phone call, messaging, hiking together, drinking together etc. 

### Knowing by experiencing or knowing self
One person‚Äôs knowledge about himself is something different, something that is entirely different from other form of knowledge. While all of our knowledge about someone stems from third person reference. Our knowledge about ourself stems from a first-person reference. While our knowledge about others is ‚Äúfrom outside‚Äù, our knowledge about ourselves is ‚Äúfrom within‚Äù. **I know myself & actions, not by observing, but by being, acting and experiencing**. Knowing oneself as ‚ÄúI‚Äù constitutes a special first-personal way for a person to know herself/himself, irreducible to any kind of internalized third-personal knowledge.

Now that we have established the scale. The question remains - "How do I move from left to right?" 

And, you might have figured it out by now that the only thing that exists b/w "being stalker" to "knowing someone as good as self" is interactions. But what kind of interactions will make sure that "I know someone as good as myself"? 

To answer that, we'd have to answer one more question - *‚ÄúWhat is a person?‚Äù*

## What is a person?

Well, let‚Äôs not get into existential crisis by trying to answer this question (I have done that üòõ). Let‚Äôs start with least controversial definition agreed upon by Philosophers ‚Äì
A person (or someone possessing personhood) is an agent which fulfils following criteria ‚Äì
1.	Rationality or is a rational agent ‚Äì That is, the agent is capable of taking best action based in any given situation. However, as ‚Äúbest possible action‚Äù is very subjective and is function of goals, ethics, aspirations etc of an agent. 
2.	Conscious mental state and has intentionality ‚Äì Is able to retrospect, plan and is able to represent or stand for things, properties or state of affairs
3.	Being subject of special stance or regard by other persons ‚Äì What does others think about him/her?
4.	Being able to give that regard to other persons ‚Äì What does he/she thinks about others
5.	Is self-conscious ‚Äì Let‚Äôs not go there (for now :P)
While this definition represents the person in a single moment (or present moment). It would be important to consider time-series continuity of person as ‚Äúpeople do change or time changes people‚Äù. Personal continuity can be of two types ‚Äì
1.	Psychological Continuity or Connectedness ‚Äì Psychological relations between different mental states and events, such as relations involved in memory, or in persistence of intentions, desires, and other psychological features.
2.	Biological Continuity ‚Äì Biological relations between different biological states and/or events at two different occasions
3.	Narratives ‚Äì What are the narratives or stories that they tell about themselves?

So this would give us somewhat (or bit) holistic framework to know someone on absolute scale:
1.	Degree to which you can answer ‚Äì ‚ÄúWhat will be the best possible action for him/her in a particular situation from his/her perspective?‚Äù 
2.	What are the things that person represent (as per him/her and others) or stand for? What would his/her opinion of events, things etc? 
3.	What do others think about him/her?
4.	What does this person think about others? 
5.	How has this person‚Äôs intentions, desires and other psychological features have changed over time?
6.	How have biological aspects (broader than looks) of this person changed over time? What diseases person might have? What are her food preferences etc
7.	What are the narratives that this person tells himself/herself about herself?


At the end, I would like to point out that it might not be possible to truly know someone as *People change*. Just think about your introductions over the last few years or introductins in different contexts. However, we just have one way when it comes to knowing someone - interactions.
