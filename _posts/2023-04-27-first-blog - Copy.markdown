Consider following hypothetical scenarios:
1. _As a huge Jitendra Kumar (the Panchayat & TVF fame) fan, I know everything about him - his birthdate, his favorite color, and his most famous movie quotes. But one day, I saw him walking down the street and I froze. I didn't know what to do, but then I remembered all the impersonal knowledge I had about him. So I shouted out - "Hey Jeetu Bhaiya, I know you were born on August 11th and that your favorite color is blue! He smiled politely and kept walking‚Äù_
2. _"Talking to an arranged marriage prospect named Karishma (fictional character üòõ), I got to know many things about her - interests, hobbies, political views, goals, history etc. One day, a common friend mentioned somethings about her which seemed wrong to me and I said 'You are wrong!"_

Now consider about following questions:
1. Do I know really Jeetu or Karishma? Which one do I know better?
2. Are Jeetu & Karishma (and by extension, we all) just a collection of impersonal facts & figures? And does knowing all these facts & figures mean that we know the person?
3. What does it mean to know someone ? Is it even possible or are we just a mystery waiting to be explored ?
4. What do we mean when we say "I know person X"? 

These questions aren't just intellectual excercise but have important implications for personal & professional relationships as we have to take decisions on behalf of our family & friends, stakeholders & users and how can we be sure whether we are doing right thing for them if we cannot be sure on whether we know them or not. 

### Is it possible to know someone?
By empirical evidences, we know that knowing a person is possible as "I know myself" and also that knowing someone has to be a scale - From being a fan/stalker to knowing myself. The scale should look as follows:
