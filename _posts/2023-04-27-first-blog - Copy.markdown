Consider following hypothetical scenarios:
1. “As a huge Jitendra Kumar (the Panchayat & TVF fame) fan, I know everything about him - his birthdate, his favorite color, and his most famous movie quotes. But one day, I saw him walking down the street and I froze. I didn't know what to do, but then I remembered all the impersonal knowledge I had about him. So I shouted out - "Hey Jeetu Bhaiya, I know you were born on August 11th and that your favorite color is blue! He smiled politely and kept walking"”
2. "Talking to an arranged marriage prospect, I got to know many things about her - interests, hobbies, political views, goals, history etc. One day, a common friend mentioned somethings about her which seemed wrong to me and I said 'You are wrong!"
