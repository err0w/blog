Consider following hypothetical scenarios:
1. _As a huge Jitendra Kumar (the Panchayat & TVF fame) fan, I know everything about him - his birthdate, his favorite color, and his most famous movie quotes. But one day, I saw him walking down the street and I froze. I didn't know what to do, but then I remembered all the impersonal knowledge I had about him. So I shouted out - "Hey Jeetu Bhaiya, I know you were born on August 11th and that your favorite color is blue! He smiled politely and kept walking‚Äù_
2. _"Talking to an arranged marriage prospect named Karishma (fictional character üòõ), I got to know many things about her - interests, hobbies, political views, goals, history etc. One day, a common friend mentioned somethings about her which seemed wrong to me and I said 'You are wrong!"_

Now consider about following questions:
1. Do I know really Jeetu or Karishma? Which one do I know better?
2. Are Jeetu & Karishma (and by extension, we all) just a collection of impersonal facts & figures? And does knowing all these facts & figures mean that we know the person?
3. What does it mean to know someone ? Is it even possible or are we just a mystery waiting to be explored ?
4. What do we mean when we say "I know person X"? 

These questions aren't just intellectual excercise but have important implications for personal & professional relationships as we have to take decisions on behalf of our family & friends, stakeholders & users and how can we be sure whether we are doing right thing for them if we cannot be sure on whether we know them or not. 

## Is it possible to know someone?
By empirical evidences, we know that knowing a person is possible as "I know myself and I am **person**" and also that knowing someone has to be a scale - From being a fan/stalker to knowing myself. The scale should look as follows:

Broadly the scale of knowing a person can be divided into three areas:
1. Knowing by afar or knowing by observation
2. Knowing by interaction
3. Knowing by experiencing / knowing self

### Knowing by afar or knowing by observation
Imagine a hypothetical scenario where there is an individual who has been keeping a watchful eye on you since the day you were born. This observer has an infallible memory and nothing escapes his attention, no matter how insignificant. He can track your movements across the world and nothing can ever escape his sight. One day, you find yourself on the brink of making a major decision, such as relocating to a different part of the world or marrying someone, and this mysterious observer reveals himself, warning you that it would be a mistake as he knows you better than you know yourself. This raises the fundamental question: can someone who has been monitoring your every move truly claim to know you?
There is certain degree of knowledge about a person when observing that person from afar. We, all have such person in our lives whom we see/observe daily during commute, in office, on social media, tv etc. We feel a certain degree of comfort with such people and I would classify this as minima of knowing someone

### Knowing by interaction
Interaction is a specific phenomenon in space and time wherein two sentient beings recognise themseselves as sentient beings and act/react for sometime. 

### Knowing by experiencing or knowing self
One person‚Äôs knowledge about himself is something different, something that is entirely different from other form of knowledge. While all of our knowledge about someone stems from third person reference. Our knowledge about ourself stems from a first-person reference. While our knowledge about others is ‚Äúfrom outside‚Äù, our knowledge about ourselves is ‚Äúfrom within‚Äù. I know myself & actions, not by observing, but by being, acting and experience. Knowing oneself as ‚ÄúI‚Äù constitutes a special first-personal way for a person to know herself/himself, irreducible to any kind of internalized third-personal knowledge.
